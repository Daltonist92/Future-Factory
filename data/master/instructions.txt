Welcome to Future Factory!

Goal: Build a factory to produce your cars as fast as you can. Start with $5,000 and initial supplies (iron, coal, copper, glass, rubber) to craft cars using Working Stations (WS) and Inventory Racks (INV).

How to Play:
1. Buy Stuff:
   - Click "Buy Working Station" or "Buy Inventory Rack" ($100 each).
   - Left-click to place on the grid, right-click to cancel.

2. Move Things:
   - Click and drag WS (squares) or INV (triangles) to reposition.

3. Configure:
   - Double-click a WS to set a tool (e.g., Smelter makes steel).
   - Double-click an INV to set accepted materials (e.g., iron, coal).

4. Create Flows:
   - Right-click a dot on a WS/INV to start a flow.
   - Right-click another dot to connectâ€”arrows move materials.

5. Run Turns:
   - Click "Start Auto-Turn" to start reunning time abd processing materials through your factory.
   - You can always pauseand think!

6. Save & Exit:
   - "Save Layout" to keep progress.
   - "Back to Launcher" or "Quit" to leave.

Tips:
- WS states: Idle (S:1), Processing (S:2), Ready (S:3), Blocked (S:4).
- Connect INV to WS to supply materials, WS to INV to store outputs.
- Chain tools: Smelter (iron + coal = steel), Forge (steel = casting), etc., up to Car Assembler.

Have fun building your car empire!
